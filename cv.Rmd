time by 10% through modular coding and documentation enhancements.

Genentech *Jun 2023 - Jun 2024* Research Associate I South San
Francisco, CA

• Determined BrdU activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) for 100+ novel drugs to evaluate immunogenicity risk

• Employed single-cell genomic profiling techniques to investigate
cellular drug response, identifying novel drug-target interactions and
potential biomarkers

• Conducted ELISPOT assays to assess cellular immune responses,
providing valuable insights into CD4 T-cell proliferation and cytokine
production in response to novel drugs

• Refined a standardized PBMC isolation protocol to consistently yield
high-quality cell populations, achieving a 95% success rate and
viability

• Developed and implemented custom automation scripts that streamlined
data processing, analysis, and reporting processes

Samsung Bioepis, Inc. *Jul 2022— Aug 2022* MSAT Manufacturing Science 2
Intern Incheon, South Korea

column preparation, analytical equipment maintenance, and purification
performance observation

• Programmed on UNICORN software to design column-specific methodology
to optimize monoclonal antibodies yield on AKTA chromatography systems

• Conducted extensive literature review in troubleshooting low yields of
expired resin to elongate its lifetime for cost-effective usage.

Miller Lab, UC Berkeley *Aug 2021— Dec 2022* Research Assistant
Berkeley, CA

• Developed Python code to automate photon counting for cardiomyocytes,
enabling the extraction of valuable Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
Microscopy (FLIM) data

• Developed the workflow for the initial synthesis of liposomes,
enabling the exploration of lipid composition’s effect on the behavior
of fluorescent dyes

• Performed qualitative characterization of liposome using an inverted
microscope and conducted in-depth analysis of their fluorescence
lifetime

• Utilized Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to ensure data consistency in
the comprehensive characterization of liposomes

Fellowship Proposal \| General Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Laboratory UC Berkeley

Conservation of functionality in Cin8 between Chaetomium thermophilum
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for future cancer research

• Conducted molecular cloning, PCR, cell culture, western-blot, protein
purification, and selection of yeast Cin8p, followed by characterization
with analytical in vitro and in vivo assays, including ATPase assay,
NADH assay, affinity chromatography, and fluorescent imaging to track
the localization of GFP labeled constructs

• Performed literature search to design hypotheses and experiments to
testify Cin8p’s structural and functional conservation across species
and utilized collected data for analysis report and mock-grant proposal.
